## Features
  This program checks if a connection can be made with your server every 5 minutes. If it can't the your computer will be shut down (You will have a 30 sec. delay in which you can cancel by closing the window)
## Usage
  You need to run AutoShutDown.py after turning on the server, and the last player to leave must turn off the server by entering the "/stop" command in minecraft.
  Edit the file if you are running the server in a port which is not 25565
